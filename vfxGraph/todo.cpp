/*

top priority items:

- add node which generates a trigger signal once when a graph is created

+ add ability for nodes to report warnings and errors -> RealTimeConnection::getNodeIssues

- make it possible to have voice nodes in audio graph which do not generate audible sound ?

- add an option to audio graph and poly audio graph nodes to output audio or not
	- complication : the voice mgr is set outside of our scope. perhaps.. add voice or not to the voice mgr depending on option ? generateAudio using our own voice list only

- add options to poly and regular audio graph nodes to output mono, stereo, or multi-channel
	- requires an extra mixing level ? perhaps add a voice manager interface. or store voices in audio graph ? let voice manager allocate channel indices, but do mixing itself differently ? or perhaps add voice groups or something ..

- fix issue with recursive GPU timers

- add console based vfx graph app which lets one run a graph from the command line
	- manually specify tick rate/time step
	- listen to keyboard to quit
	- fix issues with nodes that come up

- add ability for audio nodes to draw a filter response graph ?
	- or add to audio graph manager : draw filter response and FFT of selected node/socket

- add shared control value inputs to poly audio graph node
	- make sure both the poly and the regular audio graph nodes have both type of inputs

- add DC blocker node

# add ability to add a note to a node -> adding comment boxes instead

todo :
- add undo/redo support. just serialize/deserialize graph for every action?
	- note : serialize/deserialize entire graph doesn't work nicely with real-time connection
			 we will need to serialize node on remove and re-add/restore it during undo (also invoking real-time connection)
			 same for links and all other actions. we need to perform the opposite action on undo
- add ability to randomize input values
- add suggestion based purely on matching first part of string (no fuzzy string comparison)
	- order of listing should be : pure matches, fuzzy matches, history. show history once type name text box is made active
	- clear type name text box when adding node
- visualize direction of link data flow
- investigate VVVV's ability to turn everything into vectors of values and to combine lists
	# add channels combine method (for now?)
		+ combine idea is pretty much covered by merge node
	- add node where channel values can be added to a list -> allow to experiment with combine node
 	- add automatic combine behavior when connecting multiple channels to the same input ?
 		- default to cycle. add link map to override behavior ? (clamp, pad zero)
- double click node to perform node-specific action
	# add real-time editing callback for double click event
		+ add an editor callback to the node type definition instead. the graph editor should be fully functional without real-time editing interface and an implementation running in the backgroup, meaning resource editing should work regardless of real-time interface
	- open text editor for ps/vs when double clicking fsfx node
	- open sub graph for container nodes. in a new window ?
	- open visual editor for wavefield nodes
- add sub-graph container node. to help organize complex graphs
	- open container when double clicking container node
	- determine how to save nodes hierarchically contained
	- the inputs and outputs of the container node and how it all works should all be implementation-defined I think
- make links use bezier curves
- hide node text until mouse moves close to node ? makes the screen more serene and helps optimize UI drawing
- look at Bitwig 2 for inspiration of node types
- improve node auto un-folding and socket connect behaviors
	- (temporarily) un-fold node when it is the only selected node. allows connecting sockets
	- (temporarily) un-fold hovered over node when connecting sockets. currently based on distance, but should also include hit test
	- move hovered over node in front of others?
- NanoVG includes an interesting blurring algortihm used for blurring fonts. integrate ?
- add third 'node minification' option: show only active inputs and outputs
	so we have three options then: show everything, show only active i/o and fully collapsed
- add ability to reference nodes? makes graph organization more easy
- drag link into empty space = open node type selection menu
- add text field to node type select
- raise a menu when socket connect is released on a node itself. ask for which socket to connect to
- OSC endpoint: resend count? or just OSC send node?


todo : creativity investigation :
- add scratch mode. scratch over nodes and trigger real-time connection events
- add string mode. drag mouse over screen, let node links react as if they were being pulled. add real-time connection callback for the string location. let links/strings vibrate for a while after being pulled
- add fire mode. slowly 'deteriorate' node input values over time using a random walk. add a real-time connection callback to tell the system a node is burning


todo : nodes :
- add sample.float node
	- output value as float
	- output value as channel
- add sample.image node
	- specify normalized vs screen coords?
- add sample.channel node
	- filter is enum: auto, linear or off. auto will look at continuous flag of channels input
- add doValuePlotter to ui framework
- add quantize node
- investigate ways of composing/decomposing image data and masking
	- is it possible to create a texture sharing data with a base texture and to just change the rgba swizzling?
- timeline node updates:
	- add (re)start input trigger
	+ can be very very useful to trigger effects
	- add time! input trigger. performs seek operation
- add pitch control to oscillators ?
- add pulse size to square oscillator
- add note (like C1) to MIDI note
- add adsr node
- perhaps add string names to channels, for more convenient selection ? would reduce remixing capability I fear .. maybe let nodes which produce channels to document in their node description what those channels represent, semantically .. but not let the user use those semantics to select channels
- add image to image_cpu node. default behaviour is to delay by a few frames
- add integral image node. expose integral as 2d channels object
	- add integral node
	- add sample integral node. add normalized sample xy option. if normalized any input can be used for sampling
		- samples a rect. has x1 y1 x2 y2 coords
		- has a filter option?
		- has a normalized coords option
		- has an option to fix coords so it always specified min/max for box or not ?
- add yuvToRgb node
	+ add node and shader
	+ let user select colour space
	- verify color spaces. check what avcodec does, QuickTime player, etc .. there's many ways to go from yuv -> rgb !
- add depth data threshold node. actually this is more like a general purpose channel value threshold node ..
	- select which channel contains depth
	- remove items from channels where depth at index fails test
		- allocate new channels object to store results
	- add range min/max range + pass if inside or outside boolean
- add memory node ? get/set named variables. how to ensure processing order ? or maybe for vfx <-> c++ communication only in which case order is guaranteed
- add ability for nodes to trigger again (process a partial time slice ?). but this will re-introduce again the issue of execution order of triggers ..
- add channels.toImage node ?
- add play/stop/pause/resume triggers to video node
- add curl noise node
- text array node : custom editor for list of strings
- add gen.random node with different modes. white, pink, brown
- add gen.brownian
- add a dedicated shader node. no pre-defined inputs at all. output an image
- rename fsfx v1 to imfx ? redefine behavior to run shader over an image. expressly output as image
- the turbojpeg library has a custom callback function that can run over the DCT coefficients. investigate the crazy things that can be done with those! int (*customFilter)(short *coeffs, tjregion arrayRegion, ..)


todo : UI
- make nodes into lilly shapes ?
	- the lilly is round so doesn't prefer a certain direction. democracy for the nodes !
	- let the petals become outputs
	- so a lilly is a circle with petals. clicking around the circle's radius will let you reorient the lilly -> which will set the output socket orientations. more freedom, love and happiness for all !
	- let lillies grow when planted
	- 'Victoria Regina', the largest water lilly known to man. found in the rain forest. and on a lamp post somewhere in Rotterdam, with the story of two brothers and their greeen house
	- allocate link colours based on hue, where the hue is 360 / numTypes * indexOfTypeInTypeDefinitionLibrary
		- it will be such a happy sight to behold :-)
- add ability to set node to horizontal or vertical mode. vertical mode hides socket names/is more condensed
	- maybe also a sphere mode ?
	*** I think I like the lilly idea better

todo : documentation
- write about design philosophy

todo : framework
- add drawSphere function
- add API for custom sound processing and voices. hook into the global audio output
- check ShaderUtil.txt. add functions

+ add ability to route connections
	+ add route point editing
	+ save/load route points
+ report OpenGL texture format and memory usage in node getDescription
+ add ability to store resource data in nodes, so nodes can persist their own data when editing
+ add channels visualizer
+ add ability to add multiple connections to input sockets ? similar to 4dworld ?
+ add ability to specify in/out mapping on a per-link basis. make it operate similar to how adding multiply connections to input sockets works in 4dworld
	+ have a single floating point connection (float pointer). this is how things currently work
	+ have multiply floating point connections. store float pointers in array. allocate storage for calculating sum. make update() method to update summed value

+ add node editors. when double clicking a node (or some other gesture/interaction), show the node editor. let the node editor operate on the node's data.
	+ let the node editor be independent of the implementation ? it should be possible to have a fully functional graph, graph node and resource editing environment without a live version of the graph running in the background. this means the saveBegin real-time editing callback should be removed again once we got this working
 + fix issue with unable to close node type selection menu without selecting a node
+ remove registration instance name from VFX_NODE_TYPE
+ add passthrough mode sequence node
+ add custom draw surface node to enable better passthrough behavior
+ add support for showing multiple notifications
+ search node types based on display name. until a dot is included. switch to full type name when a period is present
+ push a dummy surface when drawing nodes not connected to the display node
+ report shader error log (FSFX, FSFX v2 and shader nodes)
+ add 'float' boolean to surface node. default.. true ?
	+ used a format option instead
+ add draw.text class
+ add the ability to have dynamic input sockets. use cases: shaders, sub graphs
	+ add support for recovering connections
	+ add support for recovering immediate values
	+ add dynamic stuff to VfxGraph so as not to bother each and every node with having to store dynamic links, immediate values, etc ?
+ add the ability to have dynamic output sockets. use cases: sub graphs
	+ add support for recovering connections
# add explicit categories to vfx nodes
	# decided I don't like it. use first part of node type name to decide category
	# use last part of node type name as the display name to keep the graph editor UI clean
# add FSFX shaders. use built-in shaders ?
	+ copied gaussian shadr to fsfx/ folder
 + add FSFX shaderSource which exposes main function and uses applyFsfx function from .fsfx file to change pixels. also exposes shared uniforms, applies alpha blended, opacity control, color mode and color post
+ fix issue with link mappings not being restored updating dynamic sockets
+ fix SDL text input when selecting a text field before the previously active one (start before stop). done : test IME support
+ add mouse cursor to user interface
+ fix issue where freeing texture here can result in issues when drawing visualizer. tick of visualizer should always happen after cpuToGpu tick, but there's no link connecting visualizer to the node it references, so tick order is undefined .. ! -> maybe update visualizer in draw. or never capture references (to textures ID's or whatever) in visualizer. only let it copy values by value (as needed for graph) but capture everything else on draw
	+ add a separate tickVisualizers(..) or similar ? it would run after evaluating the vfx graph, so get the latest values. conceptually, doing the regular tick before the vfx graph also makes sense, as it ensures vfx graph uses the latest version of the graph. so editor.tick, vfxGraph.tick/draw, editor.tickVisualizers. editor.draw, composite vfxGraph/editor
+ add copy and paste text support
+ create separate avGraph and vfxGraph projects with CMake files
+ decouple visualizers from nodes. when hit testing, sort elems by z-key, add ptr to node or visualizer

	+ add GPU timer object
	+ add GPU time to vfx node base
 + add a list of xml files to click on to 900-devgrounds for more rapid testing
# how to convert multiple channels to gpu image with channel(s).toGpu ?
	# removed support for multiple channels for one output socket. always using a single channel resolves this issue
+ fix issue with immediate values not being restored properly for most types
+ add immediate value support channel data
+ add ability to add node between nodes
	+ auto detect compatible socket types. find match based on first/primary input/output to see if it's valid to insert
	+ show filtered node type selection menu
	+ add filter type of node type selection menu. types (for now): kFilter_None, kFilter_PrimarySocketTypes
+ copy links too between selected nodes when copying nodes
+ add console based audio graph app which lets one run a graph from the command line
	+ list control values and allow user to edit them
	+ research how to make a (cross platform) console app ui
	+ make graph a command line option
+ audio graph: fix issue with immediate values not being restored properly for most types
+ port Veem changes where desired to master branch

+ add channels.toGpu node
	+ convert a single channel into a buffer
	# convert all channels for GPU access

+ add channel slice node. make a new channels object from a 2D channels object by selecting only between y (default=0) and numSlices (default=1)

	# add player index output ?
	+ add image_cpu output for video data
	+ add channels output for depth data
	+ add point cloud xyz output image. or make a node which can calculate this for us, giving (optional) rgb, depth data, and an enum which controls the projection params (should be set to Kinect1 or Kinect2)
+ add dot tracker node
+ let nodes that allocate a surface push their surface as the current surface, so rendering in dep nodes happens in these surfaces ?
	+ add surface node
+ add channel swizzle node. allow it to reorder one or more channels into a new channels object

done : fsfx :
+ let FSFX use fsfx.vs vertex shader. don't require effects to have their own vertex shader
+ expose uniforms/inputs from FSFX pixel shader
 iterate FSFX pixel shaders and generate type definitions based on FSFX name and exposed uniforms
	+ OR: allow nodes to specify dynamic input sockets. use real-time callback to get the list of inputs
	+ store inputs by name in nodes (like regular inputs)
	+ let FSFX node  resize its inputs dynamically (?)
	+ match the dynamic sockets by name ? add to VfxNodeBase to try to get socket based on name if index lookup fails ?
+ add standard include file (shaderSource(..)) for FSFX nodes. include params, time, texture1 and 2 and maybe some common functions too


done : framework :

# add scoped** objects ? or prefer explicit push/pop ? -> push/pop
+ add drawCube function
+ add hq shaded triangle to framework
+ rewrite audio to use port audio instead of OpenAL
	+ rewrite sound effects
	+ rewrite music
 
done : media player
+ for image analysis we often only need luminance. make it an option to output YUV Y-channel only?
	+ outputting Y+UV is just as cheap as Y only. added planar YUV support.
+ add image_cpu value type ?
	+ extend video node so it can output Y/UV image_cpu data
	+ extend video node so it can output RGB image_cpu data
		# requires rewriting media player a little, so consume (acquire) and release of frame data is possible
		+ add Y and UV pointers to MP::VideoFrame
+ add image_cpu to image (gpu) node. default behaviour is to upload immediately
+ add image_y, image_u, image_v to video node
+ double check image.toGpu node uses optimized code path for converting single channel source to texture
+ add option to disable texture generation
+ add image_cpu to image (gpu) node. default behaviour is to upload immediately
+ add openAsync call which accepts OpenParams

done : UI
+ add drop down list for (large) enums
+ add load/save notifications to UI., maybe a UI message that briefly appears on the bottom. white text on dark background ?
+ touch zoom on moving fingers threshold distance apart. also, try to convert normalized touch coords into inches or cms
+ fix issue with shift + <char> not resulting in desired character in text fields


done : audio graph
+ add ramp down option when freeing audio graph instances
