// the dot detector can optionally use a grid to speed up looking up near islands. without it it needs
// to iterate each generate island. with the grid, generated islands are placed in grid cells, and the
// detector only needs to iterate islands in the cells the current pixel is close to. it's significantly
// faster to use a grid when the number of islands is high. at a small number of islands the speed
// difference is neglicable. the quality of the search should be slightly better, as the grid based
// solution picks the nearest island, not just the first island it sees within the maximum radius

#define USE_GRID 1 // improves matching result as we find the closest island when enabled. also greatly increases detection speed when there's many dots being detected

#if __SSE2__
	#define USE_SSE2 1 // improves thresholding and detection speed
#else
	#define USE_SSE2 0
