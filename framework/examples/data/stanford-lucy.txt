Lucy
Source: Stanford University Computer Graphics Laboratory
Scanner: Stanford Large Statue Scanner
Number of scans: 47
Total size of scans: 58,241,932 points (approx 116 million triangles)
Reconstruction: vrip at 0.5 mm, holefilling
Size of reconstruction: 14,027,872 vertices, 28,055,742 triangles
Comments: hole-free, but contains small bridges due to space carving, so its topological genus is larger than it appears.
It may also have a few topological problems, making it not a proper manifold. Thanks to the Chaos Group for the rendering above.
Range data:
lucy_scans.tar.gz ( SD format; 155 MB compressed, 325 MB uncompressed)
Note about this range dataset: Lucy was scanned on two separate occasions. The raw range data (lucy_scans.tar.gz) and the VRIPped reconstruction (lucy.tar.gz) unfortunately do not correspond to the same scan of the statue. Moreover, the raw range data was never aligned, so the *.xf transform files in lucy_scans.tar.gz (as well as those in lucysd.tar.gz in the same directory) do not register the scans together.

Using Lucy: Please remember that Lucy is a Christian angel. See our reminder above about inappropriate uses of this model. 
Feel free, however, to build a lego replica of Lucy, as David Winkler has done. Check out his explanation of the conversion process. You can also download the plans and build it yourself.
