
=== Notes for LibRaw contributor ===

0. Repository
   LibRaw public repository is located on GitHub
   URL: 
    http://github.com/LibRaw/LibRaw - main page
    git://github.com/LibRaw/LibRaw.git - git URL

If you wish to participate in LibRaw development please use GitHub fork.

1. Some files in internal/ folder are generated from dcraw/dcraw.c file
   by simple preprocessor internal/preprocess.pl (you need perl to run it)

   dcraw/dcraw.c is a *patched* dcraw (and foveon processng code is removed
   due to copyright).

   'Official' dcraw.c changes are tracked by LibRaw team and merged to 
   head revision at regular basis.

   So, if you want to change code in internal/*.cpp files you need to change
   dcraw/dcraw.c (and run make)

2. For developer's work use Makefile from GitHub 
   It contains rules to re-generate
   internal/*cpp from dcraw/dcraw.c

3. LibRaw distribution files are prepared by ./mkdist.sh script
   This script
     - regenerates internal/*cpp without #line directives
     - generates ./configure script from autotools stuff
     - removes developer Makefile
     - fetches 'Official' dcraw.c from Dave Coffin's site
     - removes .PSD files from doc/
     - removes itself

3. Please do not use ./configure script in development environment.
   This script generates Makefile from ./Makefile.in for use in production.
   The generated Makefile does not contain section to build internal/*
   from dcraw/dcraw.c
