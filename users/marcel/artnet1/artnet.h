/*
ArtNet is a protocol used to send light and media data over udp/ip.

The implementation provided here is very minimal. You will need to manage your udp/ip socket(s) yourself.
ArtnetPacket merely assists with constructing ArtNet data packets, ready to be sent over the network.

ArtNet commonly uses port 6454.

Also, this implementation only focuses on DMX right now.
