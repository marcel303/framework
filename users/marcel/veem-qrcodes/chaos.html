		<h1>Chaos</h1>
		<p>
			Four rings connected by joints. Each joint offering only one degree of freedom, a rotation around one single axis.
		</p>
		<p>
			Systems like these, although seemingly simply, often create complex and chaotic movement.
		</p>
		<p>
			The double pendulum is another variation on this principle. Simple systems, for which it is very hard to predict the exact movement even in the very near future.
		</p>
		<p>
			Points along the rings can be sampled to produce complex moving (x, y, z) variables, which can in turn be used to drive the control variables used during sound synthesis.
		</p>
		<p>
			The chaotic element seems to be a fundamental property of nature. In nature, systems often show complex behavior, which can be understood better through knowledge of chaos theory and how simple periodic systems (like a series of rings rotating around one axis), can become seemingly chaotic or 'unstable', as more variables are introduced into the system and combined with each other.
		</p>
		<p>
			The rings can be made smaller and bigger, enlarging and shrinking the possibility space for the sampled (x, y, z) values. The cyclic expansion and contraction can be seen as a reference to the theorized big crunch which some physicists suggest could be the explanation for the big bang: a never ending series of expansions and contractions, under the influence of gravity.
