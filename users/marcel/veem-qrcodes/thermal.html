		<h1>Thermal sounds</h1>
		<p>
Inspired by the radiator noises in my room I made a model of a heat transfer system. The system heats up and cools down given the environment temperature and heat applied to the system. The system is modeled as a number of vertical 'bars'. To visually represent the heat, these bars expand and contract in the vertical dimension. 'Events' are triggered whenever a part of the system heats up or cools down beyond a certain threshold. When this threshold is reached, a 'gasp' occurs. The system which was previously building up energy, finding itself its tension more and more increasing, finds a way to release some of its energy and tension by sending out a signal.

For this installation, the system is modeled and simulated on a laptop. The laptop receives signals from a variety of sensors. This data is fed into the model as a source of heat. The events triggered by the system are used to directly influence the composition of the sound.
