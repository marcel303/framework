To install, cd to this directory, make, sudo make install.

To build this version, you need the shared libraries

  libclthreads-2.4.0
  libclxclient-3.6.1       

and the corresponding header files. They are available at

  <http://www.kokkinizita.net/linuxaudio/downloads>

To install into /usr instead of /usr/local modify the
definition of 'PREFIX' in the Makefile.

Note: the 'make install' step is necessary to make
the application work - it expects to find some files
in $PREFIX/share/zita-rev1.
