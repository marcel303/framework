<p> REV1 is a reworked version of the reverb originally developed for
Aeolus. Its character is more 'hall' than 'plate', but it can be used
on a wide variety of instruments or voices. It is not a spatialiser -
the early reflections are different for the L and R inputs, but do not
correspond to any real room. They have been tuned to match left and right
sources to some extent.</p>
<p>In <b>Stereo</b> mode a dry/wet mix control is provided, so it can
be used either as an insert or in send/return mode. For mono just
connect one of the two channels.</p>
<p>In <b>Ambisonic</b> mode (selected by the -B command line option)
the only option is the send/return mode.</p>

<p> The rotary knobs can be used in two ways:</p>
<p> * Click on the knob with the <b>left</b> mouse button, keep it pressed
and move either left..right or up..down.</p>
<p> * Using the <b>mouse wheel</b>. Press Shift for smaller steps.</p>
<p>From Left to right we have:</p>
<p><b>* Delay.</b> A delay of 20 to 100 ms operating on the 'wet'
signal. Large values will provide the impression of a larger room.</p>
<p><b>* Reverb time controls.</b> The reverb time (RT60) can be set
at low and mid frequencies in the range of 1 to 8 seconds. The range
affected by the 'Low' control is determined by the frequency setting
to the left of it. At high frequencies the reverb time will decrease,
this is controlled by the 'HF damping' control. The value set is the
frequency at which the reverb time will be half the mid-frequency 
value.</p> 
<p><b>* Equaliser.</b> Two parametric filter sections can be used to
change the character of the reverb. The operate on the 'wet' signal
only of course. The bandwidths are fixed, and somewhat higher than
the medium setting of a typical equaliser.<p> 
<p><b>* Dry/wet mix.</b> This is provided in stereo mode only. When
the reverb is used in send/return mode this should be set to the
full 'wet' position.</p>
<p><b>* XYZ gain.</b> This is provided in ambisonic mode only, and
controls the relative gain of the first order signals. This can be
used to change the 'spatiality', and also to adapt the output to
the normalisation standard used downstream.</p>
<p>The EQ and output controls are 'dezippered'. The others are not
and may (but usually don't) cause side effects when modified.<p>
