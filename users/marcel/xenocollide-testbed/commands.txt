collide                        Single-step the XenoCollide algorithm using the top two shapes on the shape stack (same as "step")

detail <n>                     Sets the detail level of the render mesh that is generated for each shape (1-6)
diff                           Remove the top two shapes from the shape stack and push their Minkowski difference onto the stack
disc <radius>                  Creates a circular disc of radius "radius" (default 50)
disc <radiusX> <radiusY>       Creates an elliptical disc using the two radii provided
drag <val>                     Sets linear and angular drag to "val" (typically between 0 and 1 -- default is 0)
drag <linear> <angular>        Sets linear drag to "linear" and angular drag to "angular"
drawmode                       Cycles to the next draw mode (points, wireframe, filled polygons)
drop                           Drop one of the rigid bodies in the physics simulation
drop all                       Drop all of the rigid bodies in the physics simulation
dup                            Duplicate the top item on the shape stack
exit                           Exit the program (same as "quit")
friction                       Toggle friction for the physics simulation on/off
football <length> <radius>     Create a football with half-length "length" and radius "radius"
help                           Display this help file
load <name>                    Loads the shape named "name" from the set of saved shapes and pushes it onto the shape stack
mode                           Cycles to the next mode (shape stack, physics simulation, probe test)
move <x> <y> <z>               Translates the top shape on the stack in the direction specified (default 0 0 0)
point <x> <y> <z>              Creates a point at (x, y, z) and pushes it onto the shape stack (default 0 0 0)
pop                            Pops the top shape off of the shape stack and discards it
rect <length> <width>          Creates a rectangle and pushes it onto the shape stack (default 50 50)
rot <x> <y> <z>                Rotates the top shape on the shape stack simultaneously (using a quaternion logarithm) around the x, y and z axes by the amount specified in degrees for each
saucer <radius> <thickness>    Creates a saucer and pushes it onto the shape stack (default 30 10)
save <name>                    Saves the top shape on the shape stack in the set of saved shapes
segment <length>               Creates a line segment and pushes it onto the shape stack (default 50)
sim
sphere <radius>                Creates a sphere of radius "radius" and pushes it onto the shape stack
sphere <radX> <radY> <radZ>    Creates an ellipsoid using the three radii and pushes it onto the shape stack (default 50 50 50)
swap                           Swaps the top two shapes on the shape stack
sweep                          Pops the top two shapes and pushes their Minkowski sum, which is the same as sweeping one by the other
time                           Turns on the timing display in the physics simulation
wrap                           Pops the top two shapes and pushes their Minkowski maximum, which is the same as shrink-wrapping the two shapes with a convex hull
