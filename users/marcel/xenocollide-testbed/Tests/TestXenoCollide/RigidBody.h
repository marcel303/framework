// These are the objects you see in the physics simulation within the demo.
// Each RigidBody object contains a physics model (Body), a collision model
// (CollideGeometry), and render model (RenderPolytope) and a unique color.
//
// The physics and render models are created directly from the collision
// model, which itself is a support mapping that represents the shape.
