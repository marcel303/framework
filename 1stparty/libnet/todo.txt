- Only let one side of the channel (channel side) send ping messages?
- Rework sending of packets. Merge packets into datagrams. Allow different "datagram channels" for packing.
	Or maybe RT vs non-RT suffices?
- Design and document order of sending events
	Manual packet submission, RPC calls, pings, channel messages
- Remove client/server distinction to enable peer to peer meshes.
	Create notion of 'instances'. You could have a server and a client instance, or just
	a collection of peer instances. On channel create, specify instance. On channel callbacks,
	pass instance ID. it's up to the game to define a server and client instance in a
	server-client model.

- Decouple packet bytes from interface. Allow extraction without copying bytes.
- Add callbacks to ChannelHandler for client channel. Make client channels fully managed.
