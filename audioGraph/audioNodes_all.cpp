/*

we create a single source file which includes all of the source files in the audioNodes directory. this serves two purposes,

1) it makes sure the constructors of the audio node registrations run. it uses a trick where at the end of the source file it includes a function, which gets called by createAudioGraph. this ensures that the source file and generated object are referenced eventually as the linker traverses references starting at the main(..) module. it's a long standing issue initializers are only invoked when objects are actually referenced. this ensure they do

2) it speeds up library compilation speed, as all audio node sources are compiled at once, avoiding the overhead of compiling them separately
